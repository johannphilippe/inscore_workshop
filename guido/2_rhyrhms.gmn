(*
 To indicate the duration of a note, you just need to write "/NUM" where num is the subdivision you want
 When no duration is indicated, it will use the previous duration (/4 by default)
 Writing the full division in the form "a*3/4" allows to specify more precisely the duration 
 The "." is used for dotted notes and ".." for double dotted
